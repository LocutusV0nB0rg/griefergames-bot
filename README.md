## Installation
```bash
npm install https://github.com/Newspicel/griefergames-bot.git
```

## Quick Start

Importing the package:

```javascript
const gg = require('griefergames');

// or (using destructuring)
const { createBot } = require('griefergames');

// or (using ES6 import)
import { createBot } from 'griefergames';
```

Creating a bot:

```javascript
const bot = createBot({
  // Authentication with Mojang account
  username: 'email@example.com',
  password: 'password'
  // or Microsoft account
  username: 'email@example.com',
  password: 'password'
  auth: 'microsoft'
  // or MCLeaks.net
  password: 'token',
  auth: 'mcleaks'
  
  logMessages: true
});

// This is async (returns a promise)
// We will ignore that for demonstration purposes.
bot.init();

bot.on('ready', () => {
  // You should wait for the 'ready' event
  // for most actions.
  console.log('Bot is now ready for use!');

  // For example, now would be a good time
  // to connect on our chosen "CityBuild" server.
  bot
    .connectCityBuild('cb2')
    .then(() => {
      console.log('Connected on CityBuild 2!');
      // Do things on the server...
    })
    .catch(e => {
      console.error(e);
    });
});
```

## Support

You will probably have some questions at some point of using this package.

The type definitions give away most of the functionality of the package. You can check these manually, or, if you are using an IDE with code suggestion functionality, such as IntelliSense, it will also list all available methods for you.
If you end up stuck though, don't hesitate to open a new issue directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/Neocraftr/griefergames-bot/issues)!
